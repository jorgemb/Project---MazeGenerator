# Maze Generator
This project generates a 2D Orthogonal Perfect maze with a 
random distribution.

## Background
This project was written as part of an ongoing effort to take on different challenges
to teach how to program in modern C++. This, in part, is also a learning experience for me as I 
grew up with legacy C++, pointers and what not. Don't take my word as the *de facto* way of doing stuff.

Feel free to use the code or make it better by submitting pull requests. I'm always looking to be a better
programmer and engineer, and I hope these projects can help you too.
